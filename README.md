![Very Legit Title](https://images.cooltext.com/5732528.gif)

Welcome to my first cybersecurity lab! This project was built as part of a Cybersecurity Fellowship to simulate a realistic, beginner-friendly environment for learning offensive and defensive security techniques.

This diagram visually represents the cybersecurity lab setup used in this project. It shows a segmented network environment built with VirtualBox, featuring three virtual machines:

- **pfSense Firewall & IDS/IPS** ‚Äì Positioned between external and internal networks, responsible for traffic filtering and intrusion detection using Snort.
- **Kali Linux (Attacker)** ‚Äì Connected to both attacker and server networks to simulate an external attacker using tools like Metasploit and Nikto.
- **Metasploitable 2 (Target)** ‚Äì A vulnerable machine on the internal server network used for testing exploitation techniques.

Each machine is labeled with its role, IP address, and network interface to help visualize the traffic flow and attack paths.

## üìÇ Lab Sections

This repository is organized into the following sections:

- [Lab Setup & Configuration](https://github.com/cyristal-gems/verylegit_verylegal/blob/main/Lab_Setup_and_Configuration.md)
- [Tool & System Analysis](https://github.com/cyristal-gems/verylegit_verylegal/blob/main/Tools_and_System_Analysis.md)
- [Security Relevance](https://github.com/cyristal-gems/verylegit_verylegal/blob/main/Security_Relevance.md)
- [Reflection](https://github.com/cyristal-gems/verylegit_verylegal/blob/main/Reflection.md)

Each section is written in Markdown for easy reading and includes commands, explanations, and insights from my beginner perspective.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Understand the basics of **network segmentation**, **firewalls**, and **IDS/IPS**.
- Explore common attacker tools (Metasploit, Nmap, Nikto, Netcat) and practice basic **penetration testing**.
- Simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios in a safe, isolated environment.
