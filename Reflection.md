Building this cybersecurity lab was my first real hands-on experience with offensive and defensive security tools. I learned how to safely simulate a network environment using VirtualBox and how to segment networks with pfSense. This gave me a better understanding of how real organizations structure their networks to isolate critical systems from external threats.

One of the most important parts of this project was realizing how attackers find and exploit vulnerabilities. Using tools like Nmap, Nikto, and Metasploit helped me see how easily a system can be compromised if it's not properly secured. Running these attacks myself helped me appreciate the value of defensive tools like firewalls and IDS/IPS.

Installing Snort and seeing alerts triggered by my own activities was a huge eye-opener. It showed me how network defenders identify threats and respond. It also helped me understand how attackers try to avoid detection, and why itâ€™s important to monitor network traffic closely.

This project helped me build confidence with Linux commands, network configuration, and using the terminal. It also made me realize how important documentation and organization are when setting up complex environments. I struggled with some of the configurations, but troubleshooting those issues taught me more than if everything had worked perfectly from the start.
